If you are up for it, the ask is to create an API endpoint that meets the qualifications mentioned above. Boilerplate code has been shared with you and can be found here. There are several files worth highlighting:

data.csv --> Subset of inspection data that we are using.
inspector.py --> The Inspector is responsible for retrieving inspections, which is made possible by calling Inspector.get_inspections().
inspection.py --> The Inspection class, which represents a restaurant inspection and includes helper methods that should help form the API response.
app.py --> The file in which you will write out your API endpoint. Make sure only to submit this file in BlackBoard.
